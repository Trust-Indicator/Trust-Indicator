 # **Client Meeting 3**

## **Date/Time:** 

9 August 2023, 3:00pm – 4:00pm

## **Location:** 

N335, CSIT Building

## **Attendees:** 

Lingxiu Cai, Vidhu Chaudhary, Tony Chen, Song Han, Yifang Meng, Zhaoyun Zhang, Prof. Sabrina Caldwell

## **Agenda:** 

Discuss the next phase of the project and the essential components regarding the development of the website.

## **Discussion:**

- **Deliverables from the Client:**
  
  1. Access to the resources - photographs and research papers using DropBox.
  2. Access to the website domain, one username and password for registration.
  3. Further clarification on the available computing resources from Melbourne IT including constraints and storage facilities.
  
- **Discussions:**

  1. Research how to extract, record and display image metadata.
  3. Do not use personal identification documents to verify authentication of the users. Find another way to authenticate users without asking for personal documents.
  4. Test group should be limited to users within informal circle and university scope.
  5. Highest priority features will be implemented in the minimum viable product.
  6. Limit users and photographs to avoid difficulties in the development of the project.
  7. Real images are not true; assertion to prove wrong.
  8. Aim is to build a trusting community and environment for the users.
  9. Types of pictures to be used: photograph - image of real object in the real world, AIGC images, manipulated photographs, enhanced photographs (to be considered in later updates).
  10. Threshold - No metadata can be uploaded to display with the picture without trust indicator.
  11. Find what constitutes core metadata information - camera information, date, timestamp, GPS coordinates, associated contact person, etc.

**Decisions:**

- Search and filter is a good feature to include later, requires further information regarding service costs, funding costs, and accessing subscriptions.
- Do not use personal identification documents to verify authentication of the users because this is a research project and we do not need to manage additional resources.
- Test group should be limited to users within informal circle and university scope so that the sources of images can be tracked down.
- Highest priority features will be implemented in the minimum viable product so that feasibility of potential features can be assessed.
- Introduce threshold - No metadata can be uploaded to display with the picture without trust indicator.

**Action Items:**

1. Draft a short paragraph describing the project obejctives and mission statement including the context of techlauncher and a student research project.
2. Research about trust indicators and previous approaches to gain user trust.
3. Make changes to SOW and add that deliverable are negotiable with consideration of the research progress.
4. Comprise a database to store metadata extracted from the provided photographs by the client.
