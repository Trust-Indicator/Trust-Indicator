## Project Description
- **Version:** 2.1.0, February, 2024
  
- **Developers:** COMP8715 Computing Project, Australian National University, Australia
  
- **Background:** With the widespread use of social media and online digital media, the authenticity of photos and creative images has become a global concern. In this digital age, the extensive dissemination of images and advanced editing techniques make it difficult for ordinary users and consumers to discern the authenticity and credibility of images. Misleading, manipulated, or artificially generated images can lead to inaccurate and confusing information dissemination.
  
- **Objective:** The project aims to develop a photo repository website with Australia as its theme, aiding consumers in better understanding and evaluating the credibility of images by displaying uploaded image metadata and providing visual cues. The website will be an open-source project, allowing users to upload their own images while adhering to knowledge-sharing (CC) license requirements. By collecting image metadata and displaying credibility signals, the website will assist users in identifying and discerning authentic images. Additionally, website members can contribute contextual information, such as photographer statements, to provide more background details.
The project's objective is to offer consumers a reliable resource to improve their ability to judge image authenticity. It also provides photographers and creators with a platform to showcase their works and offer additional information, enhancing public understanding and awareness of images. By being an open-source project, the website encourages other developers to contribute and improve, facilitating ongoing project development and enhancement.

**Step 2:** Clone the repository to your machine.

**Step 3:** Find the sln file in the directory `Trust-Indicator/src/backend/Trust-Indicator/Trust-Indicator.sln`, open it and it will automatically set up the project with Visual Studio. 

**Step 4:** Press `run` in Visual Studio and run `index.html` in the directory `Trust-Indicator/src/frontend/index.html`.

## Project Management
In managing our web API development project, we faced challenges such as increasing complexity, the need for consistency in development environments, version control requirements, and time and resource constraints. To address these, we made the following decisions:

- Use Git as our version control system to facilitate collaboration and prevent conflicts.
- Utilize development environments like Visual Studio and WebStorm to ensure uniformity across the team and prevent inconsistencies.
- Use Postman for testing to ensure the code's reliability and effectiveness.
- Chose GitHub Projects for [task management](https://github.com/Clxiu/Trust-Indicator/issues), the GitHub [Kanban workflow](https://github.com/users/Clxiu/projects/4/views/2), and the GitHub [timeline](https://github.com/users/Clxiu/projects/4/views/4) for our development process, aiming for seamless integration, simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and enhanced collaboration within the team.
- Organize weekly catch-up meetings for code review before merging into the main branch to maintain code quality, ensuring that the code is readable, maintainable, efficient, and error-free.

By focusing on integration, simplicity, and collaboration, we've positioned our team to work with greater agility and transparency, aligning our tooling and workflows with the specific needs and goals of our project. The full decision log can be accessed [here](docs/Decision%20Logs/Tools%20for%20Project%20Management.md).


## Team Charter
This [document](docs/Team%20Charter/Team%20Charter.md) elaborates on the team's goals, structure, duties, norms, and protocols. It sets a clear direction and delineation for the team, aiding members in fostering mutual expectations and consensus. The primary aim of the team charter is to enhance team efficiency, bolster collaboration, and reduce misunderstandings and potential conflicts.

## Decision Logs
The Decision Log System is a tool designed to track and manage decisions made within a project or organization. By logging decisions, including the context, rationale, options considered, and outcomes, teams can improve transparency, responsibility, and learning. This [Decision Logs](docs/Decision%20Logs/) of our project documentation serves as a comprehensive record of all the key decisions made throughout the project lifecycle. 

## Conflict Resolution Protocol
- **Purpose:**
<p>The purpose of this document is to outline a well-defined protocol for handling conflicts within our Android development team. This protocol is intended to ensure that disagreements and issues are resolved efficiently and effectively, allowing us to maintain a healthy and collaborative work environment while focusing on the completion of our APP design and testing tasks.</p>

- **Protocol:**
  - **Identifying the Conflict:**
    <p>Team members should openly and respectfully communicate any concerns or disagreements that arise during the course of the project. This may be done in-person, through 
    video calls, or other appropriate communication channels.
    Conflicts should be brought up as soon as possible to prevent escalation and to ensure timely resolution.</p>
  - **Open Discussion:**
    <p>Once a conflict has been identified, all parties involved should engage in an open discussion to better understand the root cause of the issue.</p>
    <p>Each team member involved should have the opportunity to express their perspective and concerns without interruption.
    Have group meeting twice a week on Wednesday(on-campus) and Sunday(on-line).</p >
    <p>Active listening should be practiced by all participants, ensuring that everyone's viewpoint is heard and understood.</p>
  - **Brainstorming Solutions:**
    <p>After all parties have had a chance to express their concerns, the group should brainstorm potential solutions to the conflict.</p>
    <p>Team members are encouraged to offer suggestions and ideas, no matter how unconventional they may seem.</p>
    <p>The team should aim for a consensus-based solution, where all parties involved are in agreement.</p>
